# RubikVisionSolve

RubikVisionSolve is an experimental computer vision and artificial intelligence project with the goal of eventually creating a complete Rubik's Cube Solver.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to train models capable of:
- Detecting and classifying the state of a Rubik's Cube in images.
- Automatically determining if the cube is solved or not.
- Evolving to, in the future, provide the solution algorithm for any cube state.

## Overview

Currently, the project is focused on data collection, detection, and classification of cube faces using models like YOLOv8. The ultimate goal is to integrate these steps to create a system that recognizes the cube's state and generates the sequence of moves to solve it.

## Project Structure

The repository contains scripts for data generation, model training, and cube detection, as well as organized datasets for experimentation.

## Status

Project under development and research. There is no automatic solver implemented yet.

## License

This project is for educational and research purposes only.
